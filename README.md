# Le Blog a la Zombie Outlaws

This is a fork of my le blog repo + the stuff I'm learning from Code School's Rails 4: Zombie Outlaws.


# Goal

Go Kamikazi! hack blog code so lesson examples are doable. The idea is to learn the new taught in the courses; it's not about production-ready & tested code
